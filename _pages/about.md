Since January 2020, I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/">Médialab</a>, Sciences Po. Before, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Computer Science Department of Sorbonne Université (<a href="https://www.lip6.fr/">LIP6</a>), at the <a href="http://www.complexnetworks.fr/">Complex Networks Team</a>. Before that, I was a Doctoral Fellow at the Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées (<a href="https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr">CMAP</a>) at École Polytechnique, Université Paris-Saclay. I have been Lecturer at Sorbonne Université, Université Gustave Eiffel, and currently I am a Lecturer at Sciences Po.

I work on social network analysis, network and graph theory, recommender systems, and complex systems, with applications to public policy through the study of phenomena such as polarization, echo chambers, and other fragmentation phenomena.

  * Recommender Systems (RS): graph-based recommendation, consequences of RS in social and media platforms, diversity of recommendations, evaluation metrics.
  * Graph & Network Analysis: Heterogeneous Information Networks.
  * Social Network Analysis: graph methods, propagation in social networks.
  * Computational Social Sciences: polarization, echo chambers, filter bubbles and fragmentation phenomena.
  * Collective Intelligence & Online Social Movements
