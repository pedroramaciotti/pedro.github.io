Multi-dimensional network scaling for python.

Onesto, V., M. Romano, F. Gentile, and F. Amato. "Relating the small world coefficient to the entropy of 2D networks and A python module for the multi-dimensional scaling of networks. MDScaling takes topological data (a network of connected nodes) an produces a multi-dimensional embedding in a geometrical space where distance is related to topological similarity.
